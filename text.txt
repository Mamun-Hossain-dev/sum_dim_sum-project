In the @components/ourStory component, make the following layout adjustments:

Set the max width of the content section to 1096px.

Place this content section aligned to the left side within the available 1340px container.

The right side section with the shop images and border layer is already perfect â€” keep it as it is.

Just ensure the content section sits flush to the leftmost side of the 1340px area, using its allowed max width (1096px).

Don't change any spacing or styling of the right side image section.
